# 🧠 LLM Thinking Phase & Reasoning Log

This log documents the thinking phase summaries and reasoning processes of the Large Language Model after executions, as defined in `agents.md`.

---

## 📅 2026-05-30 — Update agents.md Rules (Add LLM Thinking Documentation Rule)

### 📥 Input / Task
- Add rule to `agents.md` instructing LLM agents to document their thinking phase summary in `4_Formula` after executions.
- Update `prompts.md` with prompt details and what was done.
- Follow up by documenting the LLM's own thinking phase for this execution.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Understanding the Goal**: The user wants agents to be more transparent about their internal reasoning process/thinking phase by logging summaries of that thinking in the `4_Formula` folder.
2. **Updating the Framework Rules**:
   - Location: `agents.md` -> Under the `4_Formula` stage definition.
   - Updated wording: added the sentence explicitly detailing the new requirement: "Also, document a summary of the Large Language Model's thinking phase/reasoning process in this folder after executions."
3. **Determining the Action to Perform**:
   - Modify `agents.md` to include the rule.
   - Update `prompts.md` to log the prompt and the action taken.
   - Create a log file (`4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md`) to document the LLM's thinking phase of this execution, adhering to the newly created rule.
4. **Execution & Verification**:
   - Apply file changes to `agents.md` and `prompts.md`.
   - Create the log file in `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md` detailing these steps.
   - Ensure changes are committed and pushed incrementally/per task as required.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- Modified `agents.md` successfully.
- Modified `prompts.md` to log the new prompt.
- Created `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md` to start tracking thinking logs.
- All modifications committed and pushed to main.

## 📅 2026-05-30 — Template Sanity Check Report

### 📥 Input / Task
- Sanity check project template format to create new projects and use it as a self-learning platform.
- Place the report in the `7_Testing_Known` folder (referenced by the user as the `7_testing_unknown` folder).
- Log the prompt in `prompts.md` and document the LLM thinking phase here in `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md`.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Goal Identification**: Assess the project template to identify structural completeness, consistency, fitness as a bootstrapping tool, and fitness as a self-learning platform.
2. **Analysis of Template Structure**:
   - Inspected all folders `1_Real_Unknown` through `7_Testing_Known`.
   - Identified that while directory structures and stage READMEs are well-drafted, key files required by the template rules themselves (e.g. `index.html` at the root, `markdown_renderer.html` at the root, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`) are completely missing from the template codebase.
   - Identified minor discrepancies in checklists (empty comment placeholders for YouTube video embeds, `7_Testing_Known` directory name vs user's reference `7_testing_unknown`).
3. **Formulating Recommendations**:
   - Proposed immediate actions to create the missing root files.
   - Proposed providing skeleton/template files inside stage directories to make it easy for users to boot a project, instead of starting from scratch.
   - Suggested enhancing the self-learning aspect of the template by detailing active reflection logs and tutor prompts.
4. **Execution**:
   - Created the report at `7_Testing_Known/sanity_check_report.md`.
   - Logged the prompt in `prompts.md`.
   - Documented the thinking process in `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md`.
   - Next step is to commit and push changes.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- Created `7_Testing_Known/sanity_check_report.md` containing the detailed evaluation.
- Updated `prompts.md` with the task metadata.
- Updated `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md` with the reasoning log.

## 📅 2026-05-30 — Open Report in Warp

### 📥 Input / Task
- Open the sanity check report in Warp terminal.
- Log the prompt in `prompts.md` and document the LLM thinking phase here in `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md`.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Tool Identification**: Found that the target terminal application is Warp on macOS. The standard way to open a file in a specific application on macOS is using the `open` utility with the `-a` flag (e.g. `open -a Warp <filepath>`).
2. **Execution**: Proposed and executed the command `open -a Warp /Users/rifaterdemsahin/projects/supabase_poc/7_Testing_Known/sanity_check_report.md`.
3. **Commiting changes**: Since the template files `prompts.md` and `llm_thinking_log.md` were modified, these modifications will be committed and pushed to git as per the agent rules.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- Opened `7_Testing_Known/sanity_check_report.md` in Warp.
- Updated `prompts.md` with prompt log metadata.
- Updated `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md` with reasoning log.
